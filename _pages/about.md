I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, working at  [AI Infrastructure Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-infrastructure/) under Dr. [Ramachandran Ramjee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ramjee/), Dr. [Nipun Kwatra]() and Dr. [Sanjeev Krishnan]().

I'm interested in building more efficient AI systems (specifically centred around LLM inference), ranging from exact methods like scheduling to approximate ones like compression (quantization, pruning etc.) to tweaking the architecture itself! Additionally, I am kneen on developing hardware-aware algorithms that can actually run faster on existing accelerators (for eg. most pruned LLMs actually run *slower* in practice!). 

I am also interested in building more robust evaluations that can capture the nuanced effects of various efficiency techniques applied to LLMs. (too many works seemingly compromise the representative capability of LLMs without sacrificing anything on standard evaluations, but only some of them *truly* work)

Before joining MSR India, I was working with [Prof. Ron Shamir]() at the [ACTG Lab](). I also worked as a Research Intern at McGill University under [Prof Xujie Si]() as a MITACS GRI awardee.

Please get in touch with me via email if you would like to chat about research or collaboration!
